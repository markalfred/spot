### A rewrite is coming!
Please treat all code here as deprecated. This was originally written when coffeescript was still relevant, and before Spotify had sunset its `libspotify`. Now that Spotify has a [web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/start-a-users-playback), this theoretically be feasible once again. However, it deserves to be started over from scratch.
